RPI Transfer Protocol: trevorbrunette.github.io/ProjectRTP/

This webpage is designed to assist in searching for classes which transfer to my current college, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
Currently, it uses the JSON file which I generate/provide, caches it, and uses it for queries to determine which courses at which college transfer to a certain course at RPI. Future plans for development include: search different fields besides RPI course id, search all fields simultaneously, better CSS and webpage design.
